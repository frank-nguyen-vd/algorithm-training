# Given a matrix N x M of integer numbers
# Any location (i, j) in matrix whose value
# is smaller or equal to threshold, all numbers
# on row i and col j are
# set to threshold

# INPUT
# First line: N M Threshold
# Second line onward, matrix NxM
# OUTPUT
# New matrix
#
# Example:
# INPUT:
# 2 3 1
# 1 2 3
# 4 5 6
#
# OUTPUT:
# 1 1 1
# 1 5 6
